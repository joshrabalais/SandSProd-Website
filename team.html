<p><strong>Josh Rabalais, Director/Writer/Executive Producer:</strong><p>
<p>Josh Rabalais is a lifelong film fan, dedicated to delivering the films he longed to see more of as a child. He directed his first film in high school, and from that a passion was born. To this day, he writes films that aim to entertain and look at the world in a much different way. <br><br>Having made a name for himself, he now leads Short and Stout Productions with his wonderful wife Sydney Knight-Lagrone to take the filmmaking world by storm with new and unique stories!</p></div>

<p><strong>Sydney Knight-Lagrone, Executive Producer/Editor:</strong><p>
<p>Sydney Knight-Lagrone has been performing from a young age. From using hairspray as smoke for her family concerts, or being the life of the party, Sydney has done it all. <br><br>Supporting her husband's dream, she produces and edits the various projects that Short and Stout Productions finds themselves producing. </p></div>
